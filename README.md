Scenario:

About the client
The Greater London Authority (GLA) is the governance body for the Greater London region, which is the administrative area of London, UK. The GLA consists of two political branches: the executive Mayoralty (the Mayor of London) and the 25-member London Assembly. The London Assembly ensures the Mayor’s policies, actions, and strategies are in the public interest

The GLA has powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. The responsible bodies for the delivery of these services are Transport for London, the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, and the London Fire Commissioner. 

Initial questions:

How can we increase the uptake of cycling in London?
What are the main factors that determine whether people choose to cycle?
What interventions and changes to the transport network have had the most impact on cycling engagement?
